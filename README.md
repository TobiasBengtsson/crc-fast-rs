# crc-fast-rs

This is a CRC algorithm generator with SIMD support. Apart from the generator,
contains the cargo roots for all generated CRC algorithms.

## How the repository works

The `gen_crates.sh` generates all the specific CRC algorithm crates using the
template directory `crc-crate-template` based on the algorithm list in
`algos.csv`.

The generated `lib.rs` file contains a single expression `crc!(...)` and a
dependency on the `crc-fast-gen` crate which contains the proc macro logic.

## Versioning

In general, the crates are in sync with the version of this repository. For
hotfixes to individual crates, patch versions may be applied to only the
affected crate(s). If so, the next bump of the general repository will skip
those versions for clarity.

The general repository versions is typically bumped on changes to the generating
logic. It is stored in [version.txt](version.txt) used in the generation of the
crates.

## Benchmarks

Performance is the main raison d'Ãªtre of this project. Therefore there are
plenty of benchmarks of the CRC algorithms.

Each CRC implementation is benchmarked for SIMD, table lookup, and simple loop
peformance using criterion. Input size in bytes range from 128 to 64k in powers
of 2.

In the future (TODO), the benchmarks will be run on a set of
architectures/families and the results published.

### Example

```
~/crc-fast-rs $ cargo bench
```

## Questions

**Why one crate per algorithm and not just one crate?**

- In general, granular crates are preferred in the Rust ecosystem.
- From a consumer point of view, it's unlikely you'll need more than 1 or 2 CRCs
  for a given application. Explicit crates per algorithm makes it clearer which
  one you're depending on.
- It makes it possible to pre-expand the code (in the future, WIP) without
  bloating a single crate (making it slow to download, among other things).
  Pre-expanding will also improve compilation times.
- It's easier to review the expanded code of a single algorithm for e.g.
  security compared to the complicated macro.
- It's easier to hotfix if there is a problem with a single algorithm
- Better statistics on CRC populatity, that can guide future development
